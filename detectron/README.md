**Detectron**

Deals with the detection, and masking of images generated by the GAN. The ./buffer/ directory is used as an intermediate location while images are being processed. There are two stages to images being processed: trees are detected and masked from the source images, then the pixels outside the segmentation masks are made transparent. The resulting images are stored in ./output/. The model is in ./models/.
