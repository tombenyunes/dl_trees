**Pyxelate**

Stylizes the images produced by Detectron. Images are stylized differently depending on options set by the user. Color palettes are stored in ./palettes/ as images. The palettes are then learnt from these images, taking into account placement of pixels, quantities of each color, and then are able to be applied to other images.
